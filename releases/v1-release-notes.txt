Version: 1.0
Release Date: Oct 20, 2023

New Features
1. Intro Page
- We have implemented a intro screen that provides instructions for the game.

2. UI for Sign In/Sign Up
- We have implemented the frontend of the sign in/sign up workflow

3. UI for Bug Report
- We have created the frontend of a form that allows users to submit bugs encountered during the game

4. Navigation Bar
- We have made a navigation bar that enables users to navigate between screens (home, profile and settings)

5. Type Bar + Correctness Feedback + Progress Marker
- We've added the basic functionality for the typing game.
- As users type, each character they enter is displayed in the input field.
- The application provides immediate feedback on the correctness of each character using highlighted text.
- A progress bar shows how much text a user has typed and how much remains.
- When the user completes typing the entire text, the application provides feedback on their performance (words typed and WPM)
